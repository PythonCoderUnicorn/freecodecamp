# Learn data analysis with Python and Pandas

Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time:

1. Pandas is a powerful data analysis library for Python. And in this course, freeCodeCamp instructor Santiago Basulto will teach you how to harness this power. You'll learn data analysis by categorizing Pokémon. You'll learn data cleaning with a Premier League Match soccer dataset. And you'll learn data wrangling with an NBA season dataset. I encourage you to code along at home and build some Pandas muscle memory as you progress through these projects.

2. Supabase is an open source alternative to Firebase. It's built on top of PostgreSQL, which makes it easier to learn if you're already familiar with SQL databases. This course will teach you how to use Supabase to streamline your back-end development. freeCodeCamp instructor Guillaume Duhan will teach you about real time databases and instant APIs. You'll learn about schemas, triggers, logs, webhooks, and tons of security features as well.

3. One of the key features of CSS is its Transform property. You can take any HTML element – such as an image – and stretch it, skew it, or flip it. Oluwatobi Sofela wrote this CSS Transform Handbook, which you can bookmark for the next time you want to alter an image right in your CSS.

4. Learn how to incorporate AI tools into your web apps. Software engineer Tom Chant will walk you through coding your own “know it all” chatbot. If you already know some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you're all set to follow along with this intermediate tutorial. And if you enjoy it, Tom also created a full 5-hour course that expands upon it – also available on freeCodeCamp.

5. As you may know, the freeCodeCamp community has invested a ton of time and energy into making our courses available in other languages. Estefania has been creating Spanish-language programming courses, and she just released her newest one on JavaScript DOM Manipulation. Be sure to tell your Spanish-speaking friends. And Estefania has written this article in English if you're curious to learn more about our localization efforts.

Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese – even Ukrainian and Swahili. We're working to get these open learning resources to people all around the world. Not only does freeCodeCamp publish new full-length courses each week – we also maintain an end-to-end interactive coding curriculum. In short, if you need to learn a new skill, we've got you covered. So please help cover us. We're a donor-supported 501(c)(3) public charity. You can donate to support our mission and help us do even more: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate
