# Learn to code a full-stack app using ChatGPT

1. Learn how to speed up your software development by making use of ChatGPT. In this freeCodeCamp course, you'll watch an experienced software developer as she builds a full-stack app in just 2 hours, with the help of ChatGPT. Along the way, she'll explain a bit about how Large Language Models like GPT-4 work, so you can better judge the quality of their output. These AI tools are improving quickly. And to harness their full power, you'll want to put in the time to really learn your math, programming, and computer science concepts.
