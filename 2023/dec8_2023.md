# Learn DevOps + Machine Learning with Python

Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time:

1. Machine Learning Operations – or MLOps – is an emerging field where developers use DevOps principles to build AI. You can learn all about it by coding along with this intermediate course. You'll use Python, Pandas, and several Machine Learning libraries such as ZenML. By the time you finish, you will have built and deployed your own production-grade AI project.

2. And if you're looking for a more beginner-friendly path into DevOps, earning an AWS certification may be the way to go. freeCodeCamp just published a course to help you prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. This course is newly updated for 2024. You'll learn cloud computing concepts, architecture, deployment models, and more.

3. There's a way to represent images with code, and I use it all the time. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and it's one of the most efficient ways to store images for icons or other simple patterns. It's so efficient because it stores the literal coordinates of all the lines and colors of your image. In this tutorial, freeCodeCamp contributor Hunor Márton Borbély will teach you how to work with SVG files by coding your own Christmas tree, gingerbread man, and snowflake art.

4. Remember that game Snake that came preloaded on all those indestructible Nokia phones? You're going to learn how to code that classic game where the snake keeps eating and getting longer until it collides with itself. Along the way, you'll get hands-on practice with JavaScript. You'll also learn how to give your game a retro design using HTML and CSS. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-beginners-project-snake-game

5. Developers sometimes encode data as raw text using Base64, even though it takes up 33% more storage than binary. Why do they do this? Well, Base64 is just a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and two symbols: + and /. Just to check my math, that's 26 + 26 + 10 + 2 = 64 characters, right? This tutorial will teach you all the things you never knew you wanted to know about Base64. And it will solve the mystery of why developers continue to use this even today.

Poem of the Week:

“Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
The Base64 of I love you,
Is SSBsb3ZlIHlvdQ==”
