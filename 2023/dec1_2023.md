# Learn Cloud Engineering

Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time:

1. The subject line wasn't a typo. freeCodeCamp really did just publish a 4-day-long course. This is a full cloud engineering bootcamp developed by my friend Andrew Brown. He's a former CTO who has passed every single cloud certification exam under the sun. This hands-on project-oriented course will teach you all about serverless architecture, containerization, databases, pipelines, and enterprise cloud strategies. Clear your calendar. üòâ (107 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-107-hour-aws-cloud-project-bootcamp/

2. Learn how to code your own Instagram clone. You're going to reverse engineer the entire app, using contemporary tools like React and Firebase. You'll learn about authentication, post creation, real-time interaction, and more. By the end of this course, you'll have built a sophisticated social media app from scratch.

3. And if you want to focus on your fundamental programming skills, this tutorial is for you. Joan Ayebola explains JavaScript's famously tricky logic operators. She'll teach you about conditional statements that form the core of day-to-day programming. You'll also learn about Switch Statements, Short-Circuit Evaluation, the Ternary Operator, and how to apply these to real world projects.

4. I hung out with hardware engineer Bruno Haid at his studio in NYC. We talked about his childhood in the European countryside, designing custom printed circuit boards, Retrocomputing, and founding companies in the US. It's a fun, breezy conversation. And we do philosophize a bit about Star Trek. (2 hour listen in your browser or favorite podcast app): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/podcast-hardware-engineering-bruno-haid/

5. Tell your Spanish speaking friends that freeCodeCamp just published a comprehensive web development course, taught by software engineer and native speaker Manuel Basanta. You'll learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by coding along at home and building 7 projects. Over the years, freeCodeCamp has published many courses on these topics in English. And now we're proud to teach them in Spanish as well. (3 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/practice-html-css-and-javascript-by-building-7-projects/

I hope you're excited about the holiday season. I just put up my Christmas tree and started listening to the Charlie Brown Christmas album.
