Quote of the Week: “Early AI was mainly based on logic. You're trying to make computers that reason like people. The second route is from biology: You're trying to make computers that can perceive and act and adapt like animals.” — Geoffrey Hinton, Computer Scientist, Cognitive Psychologist, and the “Godfather of Artificial Intelligence”, talking about the increasingly successful neural network approach to Machine Learning

Happy coding.
