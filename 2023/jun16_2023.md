# Learn to Code in C

1. C is the most widely-used programming language in the world. Even when you're coding in Python or JavaScript, you're still using C under the hood. One key reason why C is still so popular 50 years after its creation is its high performance. C directly interacts with computer hardware. One way it does this is through Pointers, which point to the location of data in the computer's physical memory.

In this beginner's freeCodeCamp course on C programming, you'll learn about Pointers and key concepts like Passing By Reference, Passing By Value, Void Pointers, Arrays, and more. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/finally-understand-pointers-in-c/

2. If you're wanting to earn professional certifications for your résumé or LinkedIn, this new freeCodeCamp course will help you pass the Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals Certification (PL-900) exam. You'll learn about Power BI, Power Virtual Agents, Power Automate, and other tools. freeCodeCamp now also has full-length courses on dozens of certifications from Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Terraform, and more. We've got you covered. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/microsoft-power-platform-fundamentals-certification-pl-900/

3. Did you know that – unlike other popular scripting languages – JavaScript is asynchronous? Thanks to non-blocking input/output, JavaScript engines can continue to receive instructions even when they're busy. But this is a double-edged sword. This in-depth tutorial will teach you how to use Promises and Async/Await techniques to harness the full power of JavaScript without creating a gigantic mess.

4. Not even spreadsheets are safe from Generative AI. You can now include prompts in Google Sheets and get GPT-4 responses right in the cells. This tutorial will show you how to generate boilerplate text, translations, and even code snippets. This is still the same old GPT-4, but you may find it convenient to access it right in your spreadsheets. (12 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ai-in-google-sheets/

5. A wise developer once said that there are only 3 hard problems in programming: Cache Invalidation, naming things, and centering elements with CSS. Well, I can't help you with those first two, but this guide will teach you everything you need to know about CSS spacing. You'll learn about Margins, Padding, Borders, Flexbox, Gaps, and the CSS Box Model. With some practice, you'll develop a keen instinct for how to create CSS layouts, so you can design elegant websites and apps.

I'm proud of the freeCodeCamp community and all the open learning resources we're creating together each week. We live in interesting times. I hope you're enjoying life-long learning and not letting these new tools daunt you too much. I often feel daunted, but I sit down and start learning, and feel much better afterward.

As you may know, freeCodeCamp is a 501(c)(3) public charity, and we rely on support from the 8,072 kind people who donate each month. We'd be honored to have you support our mission as well: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate
