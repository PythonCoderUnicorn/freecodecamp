3. We've been talking a lot about the impact of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4. These are impacting software development in a lot of profound ways. And they're also making a splash in the field of cybersecurity. It turns out you can use LLMs to analyze threat patterns, write incident reports, and even debug your code. But this comes with its own set of risks, writes Daniel Iwugo. His primer will give you a higher fidelity lens through which you can look at AI and its implications for security.
