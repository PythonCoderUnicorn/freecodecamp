Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time:

1. Learn how to use JavaScript to create art with code. More and more contemporary artists are using math and programming to create digital art and interactive experiences. This course is taught by artist and software engineer Patt Vira. She'll show you how to use the popular p5.js library. You can code along at home and build 5 beginner art projects. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/art-of-coding-with-p5js/

2. It's hard to predict the exact order in which things will happen in life. That's certainly the case in software. Thankfully, developers have pioneered a more flexible approach called Asynchronous Programming. And JavaScript is especially well-equipped for async programming thanks to its special Promise objects. freeCodeCamp just published this JavaScript Promises handbook to teach you common async patterns. You'll also learn about error handling, promise chaining, and async anti-patterns to avoid. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-javascript-promises-handbook/

3. Code your own product landing page using SveltKit. Software Engineer James McArthur will teach you all about Svelt, SveltKit, Tailwind CSS, and the benefits of Server-Side Rendering. He'll even show you how to deploy your site to the web, and add a modern CI/CD pipeline. This course will give you a good mix of theory and practice. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-sveltekit-full-course/

4. Learn how to code your own video player that runs right in your browser. This in-depth tutorial will teach you how to use powerful tools like Tailwind CSS and Vite. You'll also learn some good old-fashioned JavaScript. This is an excellent project-oriented tutorial for intermediate learners.

5. On this week's freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview developer and Scrimba CEO Per Borgen. We talk about Europe's tech startup scene and the emerging field of AI Engineering. Per is a fellow founder whom I've known for nearly a decade, and we had a fun time catching up. I hope you're enjoying the podcast and learning a lot from these thoughtful devs I'm having as guests.

Quote of the Week: “I think we'd all feel much better if we instead saw bad code as a form of contemporary art. Unused functions? Surrealism. Mixing tabs and spaces? Postmodern. My code isn't spaghetti, it's avant-garde.” — Cain Maddox, Game Developer

Until next week, happy coding.
