Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time:

1. Learn Python data analysis by working with astronomical data. In this course, you'll start by learning some basic Python coding skills. Then you'll use measurements from the stars to learn how to work with tabular data and visual data. You'll pick up tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook. You'll even apply some advanced image processing techniques. (6 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-data-analysis-and-visualization-with-python-using-astrongomical-data/

2. And if you want to learn even more Python, freeCodeCamp just published an entire handbook on the art and science of Python debugging. You'll learn how to interpret common Python error messages. You'll also learn common debugging techniques like Logging, Assertions, Exception Handling, and Unit Testing. Along the way, you'll use Code Linters, Analyzers, and other powerful code editor tools. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-debugging-handbook/

3. OpenAI just released their new Assistants API to help you build your own personal AI assistants. And this project-oriented course will show you how to code up some minions that can do your bidding. You'll learn how to use Python, Streamlit, and the Assistants API to code your own news summarizer project and your own study buddy app. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-ai-assistants-with-openais-assistants-api/

4. Learn LangChain by coding and deploying 6 AI projects. You'll use 3 popular Large Language Models: GPT-4, Google Gemini, and the open source Llama 2. Along the way, you'll build a blog post generator, a multilingual invoice extractor, and a chatbot that can summarize PDFs for you.

5. This week on the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview Beau Carnes, who oversees the freeCodeCamp community YouTube channel. Over the past 5 years, Beau has taught dozens of coding tutorials and helped curate more than 1,000 courses. We talk about his transition from high school special education teacher to software engineer. He shares the story of how he earned his second degree in just 6 months while raising 3 kids and running a stilt-walking service. This is my first video podcast, so you can actually watch me and Beau talk while you listen. Or you can just listen the old-fashioned way in your browser or podcast app of choice.

All of these open learning resources are made possible each week by the kind folks who donate to support our charity's mission. If you're able to give, I encourage you to get involved, too: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: “Thanks to advances in hardware and software, our computational capability to model and interpret this deluge of [astronomical] data has grown tremendously... The confluence of ideas and instruments is stronger than ever.” — Dr. Priyamvada Natarajan, Yale professor, on the growing importance of data analysis in her field of Astronomy

Until next week, happy coding.
