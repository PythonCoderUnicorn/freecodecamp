Quote of the Week: “Programming without an overall architecture or design in mind is like exploring a cave with only a flashlight: You don’t know where you’ve been, you don’t know where you’re going, and you don’t know quite where you are.” — Danny Thorpe, Software Engineer and major contributor to the Delphi programming language

Happy coding.
